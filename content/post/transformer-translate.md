Here I describe the key steps for building an EPUB translator utility in Python. Other open source projects I found all use an API of [Google Translate](https://github.com/quantrancse/epub-translator), [DeepL Translate](https://github.com/sharplab/epub-translator) or [ChatGPT](https://github.com/yihong0618/bilingual_book_maker). With the advances in AI and Transformer models, my idea is to create a locally-run ebook translator using multilingual translation models on a single GPU.

### Transformers by Hugging Face ü§ó

Transformers is an architecture that allows repurposing already pretrained models. A great introduction to Transformers specifically in relation to NLP is provided in [Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/). Hugging Face provides convenient infrastructure for sharing, testing and running inference on models from the Hugging Face hub. We are interested in the [machine translation](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=translation) category. For the scope of this project, fine-tuned models already exist. The simplest way to import the models in Python, including the tokenizer is with the {{<code>}}AutoTokenizer{{</code>}}&#8201; class:

```python
import transformers

model = ctranslate2.Translator(model_path, 'cuda')
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
```

The model import may be different depending on the library used ‚Äì in this case CTranslate2. The {{<code>}}model_path{{</code>}}&#8201; can point to a local directory or to a Hugging Face repository.

### EPUB parsing

EPUB and PDF are the most frequently encountered formats of ebooks. Because modifying PDFs is very difficult, the utility will support EPUB for now. An EPUB consists of XHTML, CSS, image and other files. Python's [zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html) is able to deconstruct and reconstruct an EPUB file. [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) is used for scraping the unzipped XHTML files.

The difficulties of processing EPUB files can be illustrated on some examples of XHTML. Well-structured EPUBs consist of several XHTML files that contain paragraphs, each paragraph with one or more sentences:

```html
<p>‚ÄúYou thought it did,‚Äù said the old lady soothingly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI say it did,‚Äù replied the other. What‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù</p>
```

There is however no enforced standard. The following example is from a real book that contains a single XHTML with the entire text and with seemingly random formatting:

```html
<p>
  <span>They have freedom and autonomy.</span>
  <span>Which is very ob</span><span><span>vious.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
  <a></a><span>8 pe</span><span><span>rcent</span></span>
</p>
```

The {{<rawcode>}}< p >{{</rawcode>}}&#8201; tags may contain other elements, sometimes with only a different {{<code>}}class{{</code>}}&#8201;. It should be clear from the example that {{<rawcode>}}< span >{{</rawcode>}}&#8201; tags can't even be trusted to contain complete words. With a little foresight, we can conclude that 1:1 translation _and_ retaining all of the elements is impossible. Moreover, _8 percent_ is title of a chapter. Having no clear difference other than arbitrary {{<code>}}class{{</code>}}&#8201; makes parsing harder.

Thankfully, I found that reconstructing on the level of {{<rawcode>}}< p >{{</rawcode>}}&#8201; keeps most of the formatting intact, even though it removes sentence-level tags. This function illustrates how BeautifulSoup4 can be used to scrape the {{<rawcode>}}< p >{{</rawcode>}}&#8201; tags:

```python
def get_raw_texts(html_file_path):
    html = read_html(html_file_path)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    tags = soup.find_all('p')
    texts = [tag.get_text() for tag in tags]
    return texts
```

The function where an XHTML file is processed may look like this:

```python
def process_contents(translator, html_object):
    html_path = html_object.get('html_name')
    html_content = epub_utils.read_html(html_path)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
    p_tags = soup.find_all('p')

    translated = translator.translate(html_object.get('sentence_list'))
    new_tags = apply_translated(translated, p_tags)

    for original_tag, new_tag in zip(p_tags, new_tags):
        original_tag.clear()
        original_tag.append(new_tag.string)

    return str(soup)
```

A preconfigured {{<code>}}translator{{</code>}}&#8201; is injected to the function along with the {{<code>}}html_object{{</code>}}&#8201; representing the file. The {{<code>}}translator.translate{{</code>}}&#8201; returns the translated texts and {{<code>}}apply_translated{{</code>}}&#8201; tries to rebuild the original structure with paragraphs. In the {{<code>}}for{{</code>}}&#8201; loop, the original paragraphs are replaced by the translated ones and the {{<code>}}soup{{</code>}}&#8201; object can then be written to the file.

### Selected models

Several machine translation models that support at least 50 languages were considered. Two with the highest output quality were selected: NLLB-200 and small-100. These models support around 200 and 100 languages, respectively. NLLB-200 comes in 600M, 1.3B and 3.3B variants. Although the implementation is identical, NLLB-200-1.3B was chosen for balance in quality, size and performance. The small-100 is based on the M2M100-418M model that did not meet the quality expectations and small-100 also has the benefit of smaller size.

More capable models exist, but resources are a limiting factor. For example, NLLB-200-3.3B takes roughly 15 GB of storage. Loading such a model into memory during inference is not feasible on most personal computers. Quantization was used to significantly reduce the storage and memory requirements without degrading the precision too much. Available CTranslate2 quantized NLLB-200 comes at 1.3 GB and requires around 2 GB of memory. My own quantization of small-100 was done using {{<code>}}bitsandbytes{{</code>}}&#8201; as per the Hugging Face [tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/quantization/bitsandbytes). Its quantized size is approximately 600 MB.

The models are hosted on my [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/BLCK-B).

### Hardware

I decided later in the development to allow inference only on a GPU. Some configurations, though not all, can be run on CPU. CPU inference is slower by orders of magnitude without further [optimisation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/perf_infer_cpu).

Nvidia (CUDA) GPUs work best with the setup. As for AMD, PyTorch and the extra dependencies introduced with quantized models are theoretically compatible according to their documentations. This is assuming a system with ROCm compatible AMD card in combination with the operating system. ROCm is available for most of [RX and Pro cards on Windows](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-5.7.0/release/windows_support.html). Options on Linux are even [more limited](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-5.7.0/release/gpu_os_support.html).

Thanks to my friend Fjuro, I could test the behaviour on a Windows system with AMD card. The {{<code>}}bitsandbytes{{</code>}}&#8201; quantization dependency reported "Only Intel CPU is supported by BNB at the moment". Processor is therefore also a factor in compatibility. The dependency CTranslate2 accepts only hardware options in its constructor: {{<code>}}_device_: Device to use (possible values are: cpu, cuda, auto){{</code>}}. {{<code>}}_device_=cuda{{</code>}}&#8201; throws an exception related to CUDA driver and {{<code>}}_device_=auto{{</code>}}&#8201; defaults to CPU. The conclusion: ROCm support is patchy.

### Translation

A model usually trims the input that exceeds the maximum token limit. The token count of an input can be found from the tokenizer. In my experience, inputs with several sentences yield inconsistent results, often skipping sentences even with the token constraint. For this reason, the program translates sentence by sentence.

Because the contents of {{<rawcode>}}< p >{{</rawcode>}}&#8201; tags may contain more sentences, some logic must be able to split the text to individual sentences. This must work reasonably well for hundreds of languages. For sentence detection, I implemented [NLTK's punkt module](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.punkt.html):

```python
import nltk

def download_nltk_resources():
    try:
        find('tokenizers/punkt_tab')
    except LookupError:
        nltk.download('punkt_tab')

def split_sentences(text):
    return nltk.sent_tokenize(text)
```

The first function ensures that the {{<code>}}punkt_tab{{</code>}}&#8201; module is downloaded. I did not yet test sentence splitting for languages that use different sentence endings.

Creating a bilingual book, where an original paragraph is followed by translated version is rather simple:

```python
def process_contents(translator, html_object, bilingual):
    ...
    for original_tag, new_tag in zip(p_tags, new_tags):
        if new_tag.string is not None:
            if not bilingual:
                original_tag.clear()
                original_tag.append(new_tag.string)
            else:
                original_tag.append(BeautifulSoup(str(new_tag), 'html.parser'))
                original_tag.append(BeautifulSoup('<p><br/></p>', 'html.parser'))

    return str(soup)
```

This may not work so well for books with long paragraphs. The pairs are separated by an extra line break. An example of a translated book in bilingual mode:

  margin-right: auto;" alt="Bilingual text">

### How to retain formatting

This section outlines the solution for deconstructing a paragraph to sentences and reassembling it in another language. The {{<code>}}preprocess_book{{</code>}}&#8201; function iterates XHTML files of the unzipped EPUB and calls {{<code>}}preprocess_html{{</code>}}. The argument {{<code>}}p_tags{{</code>}}&#8201; contains all paragraphs of the given HTML file. The function returns {{<code>}}sentence_list{{</code>}}&#8201; with all the sentences extracted from the paragraphs using NLTK and {{<code>}}tag_sentence_count{{</code>}}&#8201; is a dictionary that maps the number of sentences to the paragraph's position.

```python
def preprocess_book(htmls):
    html_objects = []
    for html in htmls:
        sentence_list, tag_sentence_count = preprocess_html(p_tags)
        html_objects.append({
            "html_name": html,
            "sentence_list": sentence_list,
            "tag_sentence_count": tag_sentence_count
        })
    return html_objects
```

The {{<code>}}preprocess_book{{</code>}}&#8201; function returns a list of objects representing the HTML files. Such an object holds an insert-order {{<code>}}sentence_list{{</code>}}&#8201; and the dictionary holds the information about the original sentence count per paragraph.

The code in {{<code>}}apply_translated{{</code>}}&#8201; creates a deep copy of the tags to avoid overwriting the original EPUB and replaces the paragraphs' strings with the translated sentences according to the numbers in {{<code>}}tag_sentence_count{{</code>}}.

```python
def apply_translated(translated, p_tags, tag_sentence_count):
    new_tags = copy.deepcopy(p_tags)
    begin = 0
    for index, tag in enumerate(new_tags):
        sentcount = tag_sentence_count.get(index)
        if sentcount:
            tag.string = ' '.join(translated[begin:begin + sentcount])
            begin += sentcount
    return new_tags
```

One may ask what happens when a model returns a different number of sentences, which could cause many other sentences to end up in a different paragraph. Well, I did not consider this case until now. The entire logic could be simplified by inserting paragraph indicators in the sentence list. This logic was made under the assumption that several sentences could form a longer input.

### Language codes

There is one interesting issue that stems from the need to identify and work with hundreds of languages. Even the two currently implemented models use very different language codes. Finnish is denoted as `__fi__` in the M2M100's tokenizer while in NLLB200's tokenizer, the code is `fin_Latn`. The tokenizer's language codes can be acquired in code:

```python
def get_language_codes():
    tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
    return tokenizer.additional_special_tokens
```

A user of the tool must best able to select the language without searching for the specific code in hundreds of languages. Some ISO standards exist for language identification, namely {{<code>}}ISO 639-3{{</code>}}&#8201; with a [helpful website search](https://iso639-3.sil.org/). I downloaded a dataset with these codes in three frequently used formats and the full english names. The codes from model's tokenizer are compared with the contents of {{<code>}}language_codes.json{{</code>}}&#8201; and any missing languages are reported.

Data in {{<code>}}language_codes.json{{</code>}}:

```json
    {
        "alpha3-b": "geo",
        "alpha3-t": "kat",
        "alpha2": "ka",
        "English": "Georgian"
    },
    {
        "alpha3-b": "ger",
        "alpha3-t": "deu",
        "alpha2": "de",
        "English": "German"
    },
```

A dictionary maps the tokenizer codes to the language codes from JSON. The dictionary contains only the supported languages of the given model. The {{<code>}}find_by_code{{</code>}}&#8201; function iterates over the JSON contents and returns the first occurrence that starts with {{<code>}}link_code{{</code>}}.

```python
def map_languages(model_langs, json_path):
    with open(json_path, 'r') as file:
        json_all_codes = json.load(file)

    mapped_json = {}
    for model_key, link_code in model_langs.items():
        json_entry = find_by_code(link_code, json_all_codes)
        if not json_entry:
            logging.warning(f'Language code missing: {link_code}.')
            continue
        mapped_json[model_key] = json.loads(json.dumps(json_entry))
        mapped_json[model_key]['model-key'] = model_key

    return mapped_json
```

The mapped data can be searched by any of the codes or the english name. I created a console search that returns all languages that have any of the identifiers beginning with the user's input.

    Select source language (start typing):

    acq - Ta'izzi-Adeni Arabic - acq_Arab
    tam - ta - Tamil - tam_Taml
    taq - Tamasheq - taq_Latn
    taq - Tamasheq - taq_Tfng
    tat - tt - Tatar - tat_Cyrl
    tgk - tg - Tajik - tgk_Cyrl
    tgl - tl - Tagalog - tgl_Latn

    user input: ta

This works even for the case when one language has different scripts (`taq_Latn`, `taq_Tfng`). User types until a single language is matched and confirms. The language code for the model {{<code>}}model_key{{</code>}}&#8201; is set as either the source language or target language parameter. The search logic is out of the scope of this post.

### Initialisation order

The beginning of a translation workflow begins with the creation of a {{<code>}}translations{{</code>}}&#8201; object that assumes the role of a manager class for all implemented models.

```python
translator = translations(json_settings.get('selected_model'))
model_langs = translator.get_language_codes()
mapped_langs = language_codes.map_languages(model_langs, json_codes_path)
```

The creation of {{<code>}}translations{{</code>}}&#8201; does not yet load the model file. Instantiating a model takes a few seconds and should ideally be done only once. The target and source languages should be known beforehand. The function {{<code>}}get_language_codes{{</code>}}&#8201; bypasses the constructor invocation (in the model class):

```python
def get_language_codes():
    tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
    return tokenizer.additional_special_tokens

class Model:
    def __init__(self, source_lang, target_lang):
```

When the languages are selected, the model can be instantiated.

```python
source_lang = language_codes.search(mapped_langs, 'Select source language')
os.system('cls||clear')
target_lang = language_codes.search(mapped_langs, 'Select target language')
os.system('cls||clear')
print("Loading model...")
translator.instantiate_model(source_lang, target_lang)
```

For a complete overview, here is the NLLB-200's constructor. Notice the {{<code>}}AutoTokenizer{{</code>}}&#8201; and the arguments:

```python
  def __init__(self, source_lang, target_lang):
        self.target_lang = target_lang
        self.model = ctranslate2.Translator(model_path, 'cuda')
        self.tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
            model_path,
            src_lang=source_lang,
            clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)
```

### Model issues

Even machine translation models tasked to translate a short text sometimes tend to introduce artifacts, repetitions, or cut out a part of sentence. One example is the bilingual text screenshot where the last part of the first sentence is not reflected in the translation.

Some minor issues can be fixed with arguments supplied to the tokenizer, pipeline or functions. So far, I disabled unknown tokens to avoid unicode artifacts, adjusted beam size and set repetition penalty, otherwise there would be pages filled by a single word.

```python
def batch_process(self, text):
    input_tokenized = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt",
        padding=True, truncation=True)
    ...
    results = self.model.translate_batch(source, target_prefix=target_prefix,
        beam_size=beam_size, repetition_penalty=1.4, disable_unk=True)
```

There are a lot more arguments for soft or hard limitation of the model's output. I did not look too deep into the options. Certain issues cannot be solved, but they can be minimised. It would be helpful to set up a semi-automated comparison of different models and parameters if I get to optimising the output quality.

<img src="/transformer-translate/hallucination.png" width="380" style="border-radius: 6px; display: block; margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;" alt="Hallucination">

A prime example of hallucination. Here, the word _Sergeant_ led to the addition of _head of the armed forces_.

### Distribution

Packaging the tool into a contained format is not feasible. The dependencies have many versions for different systems. A user has to download the source code, Python and the dependencies specified in {{<code>}}requirements.txt{{</code>}}. The quantization dependencies could at least be lazy-downloaded with the models in future versions. The source code download-to-update approach also simplifies the updating of {{<code>}}language_codes.json{{</code>}}.

The models are optional and can be downloaded from the program. The {{<code>}}[huggingface-hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/download){{</code>}}&#8201; introduces a convenient way to download the model files:

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

def download(model_name):
    repo = 'BLCK-B/nllb-ctranslate-int8'
    folder = appdata / 'models' / 'nllb-ctranslate-int8'
    snapshot_download(repo_id=repo, local_dir=folder, cache_dir=None)
```

The model files and user settings are stored in {{<code>}}AppData{{</code>}}&#8201; so that they are decoupled from the source code folder.

### Assessment

{{<tip>}}You can view the project's source code [here](https://github.com/BLCK-B/Moerkepub/tree/2320d16400f8023362bf1ff426a53a9a7d8e8471).{{</tip>}}

The main task ‚Äì EPUB translation ‚Äì works well. There are many areas of improvement, some of them already noted. For one, sentence detection could be made better and tested on languages with other sentence endings. EPUBs with nonstandard structuring are handled quite well otherwise. Special case is poetry that typically has rows of flowing text that is difficult to process without breaking formatting.

Translation speed is rather slow even on a GPU. I will experiment with different batch sizes and several sentences. Processing more sentences together could not only be faster ‚Äì the model could pick up more context. So far, I did not find a reliable way to do that. Then, a simple benchmark integrated in the tool for quality testing seems to be necessary for any fine tuning and configuration changes.

Improvements can be made in:

- sentence and edge case handling
- bilingual paragraph processing
- batch processing ‚Äì speed and context
- quality testing and configuration
- dependencies setup and compatibility

The code is set up for easy implementation of new models. Given the speed of developments, it will not be long until a better model comes along. All in all, the translator works well, and the output quality is comparable to the online translator services.
